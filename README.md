# Project Proposal

App to point a camera at sushi/sashimi and name the type of fish and possibly cut it is through seeing patterns and color â€¦

### Project title

Sushi Helper

### What and why?

It will be an application that will identify the types of fish that is cut in front of you in a form of sushi or sashimi through seeing patterns. Useful because sushi lovers oftentimes do not know what kind of sushi they are eating, for example, sea bass or hamachi. Theyh both look similar and those who do not know, will not be able to tell the different except for taste. Would be fun to learn to identify the fish on sushi and show off when ordering in front of friends.

### For whom?

For sushi Lovers by sushi lovers.

### How?

It will have a preset database of fish with their patterns and identifiers. when the app is not 100% sure which fish it is, then it could ask taste, flavor, texture, ... to single out the fish.

### Scope

An app could be made and if it works well too early, which i dont think it will, the team could continue developing it and adding features, for example identifying vegetable sushi as well.
